There are solid hitcircles and hitcircles at 50% opacity.

1, 2, 3, 4 is the rings thickness grade.

1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 2-3, 2-4 are smaller rings. the first number is thickness the outer ring and the second the thickness of the inner ring.

the single numbers can also be read as 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-4 following this reasoning.
