# Yelloskin osu!

My osu! skinning stuff

- [Yelloskin Legacy](https://github.com/cainy-a/Yelloskin-osu/tree/legacy) - the original skin
- [Yelloskin Reborn](https://github.com/cainy-a/Yelloskin-osu/tree/reborn) - An updated version based on Blobs, with gameplay from Bacon Boi, and the Non Distracting Hitsound
- [Geometrix 「Yellowsink Edit」](https://github.com/cainy-a/Yelloskin-osu/tree/geometrix-edit) - my edit of Geometrix, with custom colours and a few other tweaks.
- [(no) Nekopara](https://github.com/cainy-a/Yelloskin-osu/tree/legacy/extras/(no)%20Nekopara) - the Nekopara skin but gameplay only
- [Lifelife Arista - Fixed Hitcircles](https://github.com/cainy-a/Yelloskin-osu/tree/legacy/extras/Lifeline%20Arista%20-%20Fixed%20Hitcircles) - Lifeline Arista's circles but correctly sized to fit the sliders properly.
- [Non Distracting Hitsound](https://github.com/cainy-a/Yelloskin-osu/tree/legacy/extras/Non%20Distracting%20Hitsound) - My non distracting hitsounds
- [Distraction***Less***](https://github.com/cainy-a/Yelloskin-osu/tree/distraction-less) - The Distraction***Less*** skins are designed to remove as much unuseful stuff from osu! gameplay as possible.
